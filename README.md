Screed is a frontend for the amazing mining-pool software [foundation-server](https://github.com/blinkhash/foundation-server) from [blinkhash](https://github.com/blinkhash)

### Setup

Make sure you have a recent nodejs version like v16. It is recommended to use a tool like `nvm` to install a specific version.

Config variables are hardcoded for now.
